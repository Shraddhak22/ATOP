## Project Description

* **What is ATOP?** 
ATOP stands for Assess The One Who Profess. It is a mobile application designed to replace traditional student evaluation form. It also provides analysis of the feedback using Machine Learning.

* **User Personas**
* Student: At the end of each semester, a student fills out an evaluation form, using pen and paper, to provide feedback of the course and the professor associated with it.
* Professor: The professor carries and ditributes the evaluation form during the last day of the class. A student from the class collects and submits the evaluation to the Assistant of the Department after the students fill out the evaluation.
* Chair/Assistant to the Chair: It is the responsibility of these designated officers to receive the evaluation packet from the student and evaluate the responses.
